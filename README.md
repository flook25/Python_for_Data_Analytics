### üöÄ Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction for a Telecom Company

[![Project Image](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Your+Project+Screenshot+Here)](link-to-your-project-repository)

*   **Description:** Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn. I performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key drivers of churn, preprocessed the data, and compared several classification models (like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to find the best performer.
*   **Key Outcome:** The final model achieved an accuracy of 85% and provided actionable insights on how to reduce customer churn.
*   **Technologies Used:**
    *   ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)
    *   ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-150458?style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white)
